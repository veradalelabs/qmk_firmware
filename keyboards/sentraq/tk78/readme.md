# tk78

![tk78](imgur.com image replace me!)

This is a QMK port for the Sentraq TK78.
I based this on a second hand version of the keyboard which I believe is from the [GeekHack GB.](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=72329.0)
There was a [Massdrop GB](https://drop.com/buy/sentraq-tk78-mechanical-keyboard-kit) as well but I am unclear as to whether or not it is the same board.
The board I have runs TMK and has an A32U4 controller
